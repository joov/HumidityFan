# 3DPrint

All designs are customizable. 

For the cases, the board is alway sitting on the "lid"-part, which also has mounting holes to fix it on a wall etc.

The _inner_box_lid_ has to be turned 180 around the y-axis before printing!

For the outer sensor the board just glued to the lid part.

For fan-adapter you should consider calibrating your printers x/y-axis (mine did not fit before calibrating)
